# Countries with MVVM

In this application, I showed the data I received from the endpoint on the opening screen of the application.
I aimed to show the details of the countries on the page that will open when the countries are clicked, 
but the detailCard page is blank for now because I could not show the data I received in the view. 
I developed this application with MVVM Architecture. I could not spare time for the UI part of the 
application and focused more on its functionality. I tried not to use a third party libraries as much as possible.
If I could project the data on the other page, I would use the SDWebImage package for the image.
